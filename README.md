The Non-Fiction sections contain templates that generate documents using my personnaly developed style formatting, and also includes templates that generate submission manuscripts which use the proper, "Manuscript Submission Document Styling" format(s) I've created by combining the methods of 3 different user-guides; "HAND BOOKBINDING: A MANUAL OF INSTRUCTION" by Aldren A. Watson (1963), "Formatting & Submitting Your Manuscript: A Visual Guide to Preparing and Presenting Your Novels, Personal Essays, Articles Proposals, Screenplays & TV Scripts, Short Stories, Poetry, Cildren's Picture Books, Greeting Cards, and MORE!" by Jack & Glenda Neff, Don Prues, and The Editors of Writer's Market (2000), & William Shunn's Proper Manuscript Format website (shunn.net)
